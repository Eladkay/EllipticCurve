[Project File](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14xt8lg5Z65VLMniyOxPDevjozZ8Hs4AT/view?usp=sharing) contains full information about the project (in Hebrew). This project was written as part of the requirements for the Computer Science - Academy & Industry program at the Davidson Institute in the 2019-2020 school year.

## Features:
* Visualization of curves over finite fields as well as over the reals
* Calculation of all [basic operations on elliptic curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve_point_multiplication), both numerically and graphically
* Calculation of various tables of information about the curves, like curve order, points' orders, addition tables, subgroups, lines of symmetry & more!
* Calculation of [encoding, decoding, encryption and decryption on elliptic curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography)
* & more...

This project is written in Kotlin, with Swing.
